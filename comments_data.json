When you have a look at the history of chatbots ChatGPT is a bit smarter, but still too generic and has all the problems in it that the internet has (hate, bias, etc) because its database is the internet. There has to be invested a lot more time to get a tool that is really useful. If you are not firm in a certain niche it can give worth hints but if you are an expert in a niche or topic it is useless. And the problem with \u201eintelligence\u201c in A.I., btw a marketing term, is that the technology behind is the simplest form of a brain simulation. It is not able to be creative and create something new to a certain problem. It is more of an intelligent pattern recognizer in a big amount of data. Helpful and faster than a human but not intelligent in the end. No system that can we trust in critical situations at the moment. The question is if we can develop an artifical intelligence without understanding how the human brain creates intelligence. Or when will we understand the human brain to start with a corresponding simulation ;-)."},{"at":"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 00:57:32 GMT","author":"2nerdsonacouch","like":0,"reply":0,"text":"We aren't entirely sure when but supposedly youtube is rolling out something that even if we have copyrighted music in our videos that we can license/share revenue on those videos?

I just started uploading videos to YouTube about a month ago and your information has been incredibly helpful. I'm in the gaming niche and currently only have 25 subscribers. When I only had a few videos on the channel I believe I made a mistake and did an order on Fiverr to promote one of my videos. As I now know is pretty common, I got a few views and they only stayed for a few seconds, messing with the retention. I saw in one of your videos that you don't get to review a channel with under 100 subs often and I thought I'd just mention that I'm perfectly fine with you tearing into my channel with some feedback. My more recent thumbnails are much better than my older ones but I struggle with getting any views.
